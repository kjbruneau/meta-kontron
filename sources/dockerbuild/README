Yocto BSP build process with Docker
===================================

Prerequisites
-------------

Docker has to be installed and properly configured.
Add your local user to group "docker" to be able to use it as user.

Configuration
-------------

All necessary configuration can be done in the file project.conf using the
following parameters:

PROJECT             Name which will be used as the tag for the docker container.
LOCAL_PROJECT_DIR   Path to the directory that contains the project data on the
                    host system. It will be mounted to /home/dev/project
                    in the container.
LOCAL_BUILD_DIR     Additional directory that will be mounted to
                    /home/dev/builddirs within the container.
                    This directory can be used as mountpoint for a big
                    file system that is supposed to be used for the Yocto build
                    directory.
SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS File containing public SSH keys authorized to access the
                    Yocto build system.

Starting a container
--------------------

Execute: $ ./init-docker.sh

This will build a ready to be used image. If configured, mount external
directories to the container, start it and attach to the console as user.

During build an SSH key is generated and the public key shown on startup. This
key can be used to authenticate at external services (e.g. github) during
build time for fully autonomous builds.

The container is also accessible through SSH with the address shown at the
first startup. The user to be used and the password is shown during startup and
usually dev (PWD: dev). This user is also registered for sudo and
therefore able to modify the container if necessary.

Please note that all modifications to the container are reverted when
init-docker.sh is executed again. Also those modifications cannot be saved
together with the project and can cause build issues if the project is used at
a different host. Therefore the Dockerfile should always be directly modified
and the container rebuilt, so the change is reproducible.
